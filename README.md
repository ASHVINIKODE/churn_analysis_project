# 📊 End-to-End Churn Analysis Project  
### SQL Server | Power BI | Python | Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline for customer churn prediction using SQL Server for ETL, Power BI for visualization, and Python for machine learning. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and predict churn using a Random Forest model.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL Server** – ETL, data cleaning, staging tables  
- **Python** – pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning** – Random Forest Classifier  
- **Power BI** – data modeling, DAX, dashboards  

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **ETL in SQL Server**  
   - Imported raw data into staging tables  
   - Performed data cleaning, transformations, and quality checks  
   - Loaded cleaned data into final tables  

2. **Power BI Dashboard**  
   - Data modeling & transformations  
   - KPIs: churn rate, customer segments, tenure analysis, revenue impact  
   - Visuals: line charts, bar charts, cards, slicers, profile pages  

3. **Machine Learning Model**  
   - Feature engineering & preprocessing  
   - Trained Random Forest to predict customer churn  
   - Evaluated accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance  

4. **Churn Prediction Visualization**  
   - Loaded Python predictions into Power BI  
   - Created a churner profile to support business strategy  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified high-risk churn segments  
- Showed impact of tenure, contract type, monthly charges  
- Predicted churn probability for each customer  

---

## 📂 Output
- Power BI interactive dashboards  
- SQL scripts (ETL + transformations)  
- Python Notebook (ML model)  

---

## ✔️ Conclusion
This project reflects real-world analytics workflow combining **Data Engineering + BI + Machine Learning** to create an end-to-end predictive churn system.
